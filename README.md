# MPATclone: Multiple Phenotype Association Testing

## Overview

`MPAT` is an R package designed for conducting multiple phenotype genetic association studies based on summary statistics. It facilitates the analysis of associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and multiple phenotypes by combining univariate testing summary statistics.

## Installation

To install `MPAT`, you can use the following R command:

```
devtools:install_github("Broccolito/MPATclone")
```

## Features

- **Fourteen Statistical Methods:** Includes methods such as Principal Component (PC), MinP, Fisher's method combinations, and variance component tests.
- **Support for GWAS Data:** Designed to work with genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets.
- **Comprehensive Example Data:** Comes with example data `lipids`, illustrating usage with real genetic data on lipid levels.

## Usage

Below is an example demonstrating how to use `MPAT` to analyze genetic data:

```
library(MPAT)

# Load example data
data(lipids)
lipids_zscore = as.matrix(lipids[,c("Zscore.HDL","Zscore.LDL","Zscore.TG","Zscore.TC")])
Sigma = cor(lipids_zscore)

# Perform a multi-phenotype association test
result = DSUM(Z.vec=lipids_zscore[1,], Sigma)

# Print the p-value
print(result$pvalue)
```

## Functions

- `PC()`: Combines correlated GWAS summary statistics.
- `MinP()`: Uses the minimum of the p-values for multiple phenotypes.
- `mixFisher()`: Combines Z-statistics using Fisherâ€™s method.
- `mixAda()`: Adaptively selects optimal combination coefficients.
- Other functions include `mixTippett()`, `mixVarWeight()`, and `SUM()`.
